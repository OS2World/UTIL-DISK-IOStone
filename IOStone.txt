IOSTONE is a multi platform disk, file I/O and buffer cache efficiencies
benchmark program.
It was orginaly made for UNIX, but is ported to OS/2 (version 2.0 or better)
and DOS (version 3.0 or better).

Included in this archive are the OS/2 executable (IOStone.exe), the DOS
executable (IOSTONED.EXE), this file, and a directory containing the source
code and two project files for Borland C++ Compilers (DOS and OS/2)

This program should be run without other processes competing for system
resources. It uses aprox 5 megabytes of disk space. Make sure that at least
this much space is available on your file system before you run the program.

The result is printed out in IOSTONES/sec. and read/write troughput in kb/sec.
Note that the read/write troughput includes the overhead time of opening and
closing files. But anyway, it gives an idea of what your system can cope with
on a busy day.

To the users of the previous port: You will most likely not get the same
result as with the previous version. This is because a bug in the port
concerning the file name generation for the spacer file has been fixed.

REFERENCE:

A i486DX-50, 20Mb RAM, 1270 Kb HPFS CACHE, Quantum PD 425AT IDE on ISA
running OS/2 2.1 gives aprox 13500 IOSTONES/sek.

A i486DX-33, 16Mb RAM, 256 Kb HPFS CACHE, Quantum PD 230AT IDE on ISA
running OS/2 2.1 with TCP/IP and NETWARE gives aprox 4700 IOSTONES/sek.
Enlarging the cache to 700 Kb gives no performance enchancment.

A i486DX-50, 4096 Kb FAT CACHE, Quantum ELS 127AT IDE on ISA
running plain DOS 6.2 gives aprox 55000 IOSTONES/sek.
It was running from the cache, the disk light didn't blink during the test.

A i486DX-33, 1024 Kb FAT CACHE, Quantum PD 170AT IDE on ISA
running plain DOS 5.0 gives aprox 12200 IOSTONES/sek.


NEW RESULTS:

If you get results from a new (machine/operating system/disk controller and
drive) combination, please send them to becker@iris.ucdavis.edu. Please
include complete information on the machine type, operating system, version,
disk controller, and disk drives.  Also make a note of any system
modifications that have been performed.

       Added simple Makefile.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 07/21/93 Oddgeir Kvien, kvien@elkraft.unit.no

 Slightly modified to compile with Borland C++ for OS/2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 11/17/93 Ketil Kintel, kintel@hsr.no

 -Fixed bug with the file name generation for the spacer file.
 -Slightly modified to show some output while running. Users with slow
  systems will shurely appriciate this.
 -Added code for average read/write troughput.
 -Added code for number of file opens/closes.
 -Modified to compile on a 16bit compiler also (Bolrand C++ 3.11 DOS)
  An int ain't always an int...
